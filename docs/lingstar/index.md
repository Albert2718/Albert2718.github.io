This is the introduction page of this section.

The caption of this section is advised by deepseek (yes, I spare no effort to name it but fail, so I just use the "prefix" of one of my friends who sometimes begins his conversation with "i have asked deepseek..."). To be honest, it is a good name that use the homonymic character in a beatiful idiom (宇宙星辰).  

In this section, I'd like to record everything about English(mainly and currently) which immerse me to some extent. It includes but not limited to: my learning experience(especially TOEFL), my notes, my essays, and so on.

Why I am writing this in English? Output is what we need.
