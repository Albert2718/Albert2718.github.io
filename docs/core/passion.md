前几天在苏州旅游的时候，刷Quora看到一篇文章比较有共鸣，原文我放到最后了。

曾经我把喜欢、热爱等等这些发自内心的词语往往归为一谈，但后来才慢慢发现他们的分量是不一样的。  

喜欢的分量较轻，蕴含的“自然感”也更多。喜欢something，我可以在合适的时机自然地去做它，享受它给我带来的快乐。驱动喜欢的是motivation，不是drive。  

而热爱呢，just stick with it.

Q:Why am I not passionate about anything?
Originally Answered: Why am I not 'passionate' about anything?
We’re practically in the same boat. I’ve done nearly everything too- from swimming to karate to writing class… you name it.

A:I think a main problem of yours that I have as well is that you haven’t explored any area deeply enough. Face it, we’re both too lazy to do any actual work in an area that we “like.”

The thing is, the biggest misconception about people finding their passion is that the ones who haven’t found it yet think it will just click for them and come naturally. That’s not the case. Our passion is something we stick with long enough to thoroughly enjoy doing it, that we don’t even mind working for long hours on it.

Here’s the easiest way to find your passion. Pick something that you’re naturally talented at, and just stick with it. It doesn’t matter if you want to switch or you don’t like it anymore, pursue it long enough to be able to win a couple of competitions in that field. Then, you will feel extremely good about it and will want to continue pursuing it, because you feel like you’re the best at it!

The thing about humans is that, when we feel or “accept” that we can’t be the best at something, we lose interest in it and move on to something else. That’s what being lazy is all about- when we easily give up and move onto something that we think is easier. The people who actually find their passion are those who stick with one thing long enough to be at the top.

People with a passion are able to enjoy it for a long time because what they do makes them feel good about themselves, that they are better than everyone else at it. But how do you become the best at something? By spending more time on that thing than other people.

So don’t worry about not being passionate about anything right now. Very rarely will someone be passionate about something from the start. Find something you like or something you are talented at, and once you spend enough time to become an expert at it, trust me, you’ll always enjoy doing it. Passion is that satisfactory feeling that comes as a result of forcing yourself to become skilled enough to beat others, putting you on top of the world!

A great example is my younger sister. She was so convinced that her passion was soccer, because she had been playing since she was four, and she was the best on her recreational team. Then, as soon as she moved onto competitive, she quit halfway through the first season because she didn’t like it anymore. The reason? She was the worst on the team there.

And now she likes tennis. I see that glowing smile on her sweaty face every time her class is over because she is better than everyone else in the class. But as soon as she moves up a level, trust me, she’s going to lose interest once she sees how many others there are that are better than her. She “liked” soccer and she “likes” tennis because her athletic talent makes her feel like she’s superior to others in her environment. It’s a feeling that everyone strives to feel.

My sister only likes tennis right now, but in order for it to become her passion, she needs to work harder, and not just let her natural talent do all the work for her, because that’s not going to take her anywhere. I don’t see her putting any effort into getting better at it, aside from the weekly class she attends.

It sounds like that’s the same case with you and pretty much everyone else who doesn’t enjoy their work. You may “like” some things, but once you get put down by others who are better than you, you quit. To overcome that and turn something into your passion, don’t give up so easily and keep on pursuing it until you reach the top.

Best of luck!
